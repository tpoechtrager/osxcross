- OSXCross: OS X cross toolchain for linux -

OSXCross is a tool which helps you to cross compile source code easily with clang on linux for OS X.

After the installation you will have "o32-clang", "o32-clang++", "o64-clang" and "o64-clang++" available as compiler.

You can optionally build an update-to-date gcc as well, please see README.gcc.

Make sure you have the following installed on your linux-system:

 Clang 3.2+, llvm-devel, automake, autogen, libtool,
 libxml2-devel, libuuid-devel, openssl-devel and the bash shell

Then edit TARGET and so on in build.sh, so it fits your requirements.

Then run

./build.sh

to build the OS X cross toolchain (it will guide you through the installation).
