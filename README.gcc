After finishing ./build.sh you can optionally build gcc as well.

Don't forget to run "source ~/.profile" after adding the target to your .bashrc or .profile,
or simply start a new shell session.

Then make sure you have got the build dependencies for gcc installed on your system,
see: http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html

On debian like systems you can run 'apt-get build-dep gcc' to install them.

After this edit GCC_VERSION and so on build_gcc.sh, so it fits your requirements, then finally
run ./build_gcc.sh to start building gcc.

If everything went well, then you'll have "x86_64-apple-darwinXX-gcc, i386-apple-darwinXX-g++" and so on
available as compiler.
